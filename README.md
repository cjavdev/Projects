#w1zeman1p's Project List 
###based roughly on Martyr2’s Mega Project List


Going to complete all projects from [Martyr2’s Mega Project List](http://www.dreamincode.net/forums/topic/78802-martyr2s-mega-project-ideas-list/) and some others.

Some details:

* I will use Random Languages to solve these. Why? Because I want to learn different languages and when they are appropriate.
* The projects will not be made in the order posted.

I will link to each project that I complete. Some will be in this same repo, some bigger ones will have dedicated repos.
