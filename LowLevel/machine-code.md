# Machine Level

## Machine Code

Machine code is generated by a compiler based on programming language rules and the instruction set of the target machine.

GCC compiler, compiles C into assembly code then invokes `assembler` and `linker` to generate machine code.

32-bit machine can only take advantage of 4GB (2^32 bytes) of RAM
64-bit machine can use upto 256 Terabytes (2^48) of RAM

Moores Law: The number of transistors on a microprocessor doubles every 26 months.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```
How will gcc turn this into machine code?
1. C preprocessor will load stdio.h
2. C compiler generates assembly code
3. Assembler converts assembly code into binary
4. Linker merges our binary with the stdio binary and generates final executable

Program Counter or PC: address in memory of the next instruction to be executed.
Integer Register File: 8 32-bit values hold addresses or integer data.
Condition Code Registers: used for conditional changes in control flow (`if`, `while`).
Floating Point Registers: store floating point data.

How to see the assembly?
`gcc file.c -S`

How to see the object code?
`gcc file.c -c` This will compile and assemble.
